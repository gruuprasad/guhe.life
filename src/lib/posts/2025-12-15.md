Social platforms have beautifully connected us across distances, yet many moments feel anchored to the screen. What if one gently surfaced shared intents, inviting people toward real-world gatherings—and measured its quiet success by those steps offline?

Imagine Hearth (working name: Focus) as an "exit platform." A serene stream of thoughts clusters via AI into ephemeral "Intent Cards" with fuzzy locations and time windows. No in-app navigation—just a nudge to close the app and move. Posts fade by depth, affirmations reorder your local view privately. How might this foster presence over persistence?[

What draws you back to screens in connection moments? Could a platform that fades gracefully create space for offline serendipity?
