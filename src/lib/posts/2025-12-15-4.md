Do I need a social media platform to engage myself in? I don't know. What I know for sure is I don't want to engage in the platforms that already exist, major players. It feels vast, irrelavant, disconnected. Aspect of being digital would change how person engage in social relation? I don't think so. Social platforms reflect what's already in one's nature. Prpbably its an extension.

What I am trying to say is what if the platform instead of fueling the mainstream social narrative, take the offbeat, timeless, non-identity oriented, still promoting full self-expression. That's the goal, vision for the product. Its not a matter of urgency, savior complexity. Its in the sphere of intelligence, creativity. Lets add a flavor to this paradoxcial game.

What would exist as a result of these specs?
