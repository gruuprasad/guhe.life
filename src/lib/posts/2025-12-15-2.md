Profiles and names help us trust and relate online, building vibrant communities. What if a platform let the message breathe first, revealing contributors only through deliberate choice—prioritizing collective flow over individual spotlight?

In Hearth's dual wellsprings:

- **Collective** (shared truths, causes): Identity stays hidden, letting ideas stand alone.
- **Creative** (insights, art): A mindful "Reveal Contributor" tap surfaces names if the spark calls for it.

This could nurture emotional memory over archives, much like conversations linger beyond words. Does minimal identity deepen resonance or spark curiosity differently?
